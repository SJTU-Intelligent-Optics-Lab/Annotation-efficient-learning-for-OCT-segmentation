# Annotation-efficient-learning-for-OCT-segmentation

This repository contains the code for paper "Annotation-efficient learning for OCT segmentation". We propose an annotation-efficient learning method for OCT segmentation that could significantly reduce annotation costs and improve learning efficiency. Here we provide generative pre-trained transformer-based encoder and CNN-based segmentation decoder, both pretrained on open-access OCTdatasets. The proposed pre-trained model can be directly transfered to your ROI segmeantation based on OCT image. We hope this may help improve the intelligence and application penetration of OCT.

## Usage
1. Clone the repositoryï¼š
```
git clone https://github.com/SJTU-Intelligent-Optics-Lab/Annotation-efficient-learning-for-OCT-segmentation.git
```  

2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download the pre-trained [phase1 model file](https://jbox.sjtu.edu.cn/l/d1pZvS) for weights of encoder and [phase2 model file](https://jbox.sjtu.edu.cn/l/t1vDE7) for weights of decoder, and then put them in `./runs/` folder.

4. Edit suitable path and parameters in main.py

5. Go to the corresponding folder and run:
```
cd Annotation-efficient-learning-for-OCT-segmentation
python main.py
```
